# Video game timer

I decided to create a website for a game I played. There was this menu in game that required you to jump through multiple menus to access timer information in order to find out when certain bosses spawned.
Bosses spawned at different times, minibosses, and baphomets (think bigger bosses), for five different locations all with different timers. 
It doesn't track the information because they're isn't an api for this game but instead updates the times if it detects any of the times to be incorrect, check it out, and if you ever play the game it might be useful for you!~
